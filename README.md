## Task 9 (Docker and AWS Elastic Beanstalk)

### Task 9.1

    Created PR of Cart Service template repository for this task
    Created Dockerfile that will build a docker image to run the Cart Service.
    Added .dockerignore file to minimize build context.
    Files and folders generated by the application or npm should be excluded.
    Provide explanations to why the folder was ignored.
    Optimize your image/container
    Minimize docker image size is 350 MB.
    Optimize image build times. Dockerfile commands that run npm install should not depend on typescript files.
    OPTIONAL: add more folders to .dockerignore with explanations
    OPTIONAL: Minimize docker image size to about 100 MB.
    OPTIONAL: Optimize build times by utilizing multistage builds.
    OPTIONAL: Lint Dockerfile.

    nodejs-aws-cart-api> docker images
      IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
     01a0e11a9e5d   3 minutes ago   350MB

### Task 9.2

    Prepare Cart Service infrastructure with Elastic Beanstalk.

    Use a Dockerfile from previous subtask to deploy your Cart Service using AWS Beanstalk CLI.
    Initiate an Elastic Beanstalk application using the eb init command. Application name must follow the following convention {yours_github_account_login}-cart-api.
    Create a new environment using the eb create command. An environment name must be short but not less then four signs (e.g develop, test, prod, etc). Use the --cname option {yours_github_account_login}-cart-api-{environment_name} so that Elastic Beanstalk will use it to create a proper domain name. Use the --single option to not use any Load Balancer for this environment.

    Deploy Cart Service with Elastic Beanstalk
EB API: http://alami-dev.eba-mip85a3i.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

    Investigate AWS Elastic Beanstalk service in the AWS Console.
    Walk through EC2 resources that were created by Elastic Beanstalk
    Update the app and deploy changes using the eb deploy command.

    Update FE app

FE Cloudfront https://d1kybbg0rzdlcc.cloudfront.net/

    Pull the latest version of the app from repo
    Replace Cart Service placeholder in src/constants/apiPaths.ts using a Cart Service API URL you get after successful deployment.
    Make sure your app starts to call Cart Service API when you add or remove items.

    NOTE: Now after page refresh cart’s content might remain the same.

### Task 9.3

    Commit all your work to separate branch (e.g. task-9 from the latest master) in your own repository.
    Create a pull request to the master branch.
    Submit link to the pull request to Crosscheck page in RS App.


Evaluation criteria (70 points for covering all criteria)

    Dockerfile is prepared, image is building. Image size is minimized to be less than 500 MB.
    Dockerfile is optimized. Files that change more often and commands that depend on them should be included later, files and commands that change less should be at the top.
    Folders are added to .dockerignore, with explanations. At least 2 big directories should be excluded from build context. Elastic Beanstalk application is initialized.

Additional (optional) tasks

    15 - Environment is created and the app is deployed to the AWS cloud. You must provide a link to your GitHub repo with Cart Service API or PR with created Dockerfile and related configurations.
    15 - FE application is updated with Cart API endpoint. You must provide a PR with updates in your FE repository and OPTIONALLY link to deployed front-end app which makes proper API calls to your Cart Service.
